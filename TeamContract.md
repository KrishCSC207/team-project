# Team Contract

**Your team is free to revise this contract as your team wishes; we have scaffolded it with a recommended structure similar to the provided sample on Quercus.**

After you reflect on past teamwork experiences and brainstorm a list of actions required for a positive teamwork experience, answer these questions. 

Once you have all agreed on the contents of the team contract, make a PR to merge your team contract into the main branch of your team's repo on GitHub.

**Please remember to remove any of the initial instruction text when your team finalizes your team contract; it should resemble the provided sample once complete, but with details specific to the expectations and norms agreed to by your entire team.**

## Purpose of this Contract

This contract sets out shared expectations and commitments for how our team will collaborate during the course. It is designed to promote accountability, professionalism, and mutual support as we complete individual preparation, readiness assurance tests, in-class activities, and our course project.

## Team Norms and Expectations

### Communication
* We will use instagram as our primary communication channel.
* Team members will respond to messages within 10 hours on weekdays. 
* Anything related to projects, marked assignments or ability to do the work assigned to them; also preferably relay information about attendance
* Complete designated work on time with code that meets standards or notify at least 36 hours before time for any problems including, difficulty, interest or help. When generating ideas, must consult all team members and use google docs or readme to take note of all ideas (can be strikethroughed later but kept for record). 

---

### Work Quality

* All deliverables should be completed on time, tested, and meet the agreed quality standard.
* Each Pull Request will be reviewed by at least two team members.
* Must never commit to the main branch, keep tabs on when to pull from main branch so that all work is upto date.
* Fix merge conflicts only after consulting with the person who wrote the conflicting code.
* Every feature must be made aware of to the team by writing it on the readme or the google doc before being implemented.
* All code must be commented (vaguely at least) so it is easier to understand.
* Never commit any files such as .idea or target unless discussed before as they should be ignored by git.
---

## Decision Making
* Decisions will be made by consensus when possible. 
* If consensus cannot be reached, a vote will be taken; majority rules.

---

## Conflict resolution
* If conflict arises:
    - The team will first attempt to resolve the issue privately through open discussion.
    - If the issue persists, the team will involve a member of the course teaching team as mediator.

---

## Accountability
* Persistent non-participation or failure to meet expectations may result in lower peer evaluation scores.
* All members agree to provide honest and fair peer evaluations.




By signing below, we acknowledge that we have read, discussed, and agreed to these terms. We understand that this contract is binding for the duration of the course and may be revised with the agreement of all team members.
